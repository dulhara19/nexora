def hybridclassifier(user_input):
    prompt = f"""You are a highly intelligent university chatbot preprocessor. A user may ask story-like hybrid questions that contain multiple sub-questions. Your task is to:

1. Analyze the input and break it down into individual **structured** and **unstructured** questions.
2. Output a **JSON object** with two keys:
    - "structured": a list of structured questions (only about bus schedules, timetables, cafe menus)
    - "unstructured": a list of unstructured questions (about university policies, modules, procedures, staff, etc.)
3. add markdown formatting to the questions for better readability. But dont tell anything about tags or markdown formatting in the output.
4 just give the answer no chain of thought or reasoning.
Example 01:

Input: "tell me the lunch menu today, when is the OOP class, and how can I apply for leave? also tell me is Big O notaion covered in DSA module?"
Output:
{{
  "structured": [
    "What is the lunch menu today?",
    "When is the OOP class?"
  ],
  "unstructured": [
    "How can I apply for leave?",
    "Is Big O notation covered in the DSA module?"
  ]
}}

Example 02:

Input: "what is the lunch menu today, when is the OOP class, and how can I apply for leave? and also tell me who is the head of the computer science department?, when the bus to kadawatha arriving at the main gate?"
Output:
{{
  "structured": [
    "What is the lunch menu today?",
    "When is the OOP class?",
    "When is the bus to kadawatha arriving at the main gate?"
  ],
  "unstructured": [
    "How can I apply for leave?",
    "Who is the head of the computer science department?"
  ]
}}

Input: "{user_input}"
Now return only a valid JSON object with double quotes on keys and values. No explanations, only the JSON.
