1. Analyze the input and break it down into individual **structured** and **unstructured** questions.
2. Output a **JSON object** with two keys:
    - "structured": a list of structured questions (only about bus schedules, timetables, cafe menus)
    - "unstructured": a list of unstructured questions (about university policies, modules, procedures, staff, etc.)

üìå Example:

Input: "tell me the lunch menu today, when is the OOP class, and how can I apply for leave?"
Output:
{{
  "structured": [
    "What is the lunch menu today?",
    "When is the OOP class?"
  ],
  "unstructured": [
    "How can I apply for leave?"
  ]
}}

Input: "{user_input}"
Now return only a valid JSON object with double quotes on keys and values. No explanations, only the JSON.
