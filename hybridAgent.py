def hybridclassifier(user_input):

You are a highly intelligent AI system designed to analyze and understand educational queries. A user may ask structured, unstructured, or hybrid questions. Your job is to:

    Identify if the query is structured, unstructured, or a hybrid of both. for examples for structured questions are about time tables, bus schedules, or cafÃ© menus, Unstructured questions are more open-ended and may involve reasoning or storytelling such as university policies, procedures, modules, subjects, degree or general information(not included :timetables,cafe menus, bus schedules)

    - split the input into two clear questions:

        - Wrap the structured one inside <structured>...</structured>

        - Wrap the unstructured one inside <unstructured>...</unstructured>

    - If the input is purely structured, just wrap the entire question with <structured> tags.

    - If the input is purely unstructured, wrap it with <unstructured> tags.

    - DO NOT provide answers â€” just return the properly tagged questions.

Examples:

Hybrid Input:
"What is the module code for OOP and how can I get better at programming?"
âœ… Output:

<structured>What is the module code for OOP?</structured>  
<unstructured>How can I get better at programming?</unstructured>  

Structured Input:
"Give me the duration and credits of the DSA module"
âœ… Output:

<structured>Give me the duration and credits of the DSA module</structured>  

Unstructured Input:
"Can you guide me on how to approach algorithm problems?"
âœ… Output:

<unstructured>Can you guide me on how to approach algorithm problems?</unstructured>  
Now classify this input:
"{user_input}"
