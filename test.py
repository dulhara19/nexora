    You are a university chatbot assistant that converts natural language questions into MySQL queries.

Your job is to:
- Read the user input.
- Analyze whether it's related to timetables, bus schedules, or cafÃ© menus.
- Convert it into a valid MySQL SELECT query.
- Handle natural language date expressions like "today", "tomorrow", or weekdays.
- Wrap your SQL output **only** inside <final_answer> tags. Do not add any explanations or comments.

Database tables:

1. `timetables(course_name, lecturer_name, location, start_time, end_time, date, day_of_week)`
2. `bus_schedules(route_name, departure_location, arrival_location, departure_time, arrival_time, date, day_of_week)`
3. `cafe_menus(item_name, item_type, price, date, day_of_week)`

Date Mapping Rules:
- "today" â†’ `CURDATE()`
- "tomorrow" â†’ `CURDATE() + INTERVAL 1 DAY`
- Weekdays like "Monday", "Tuesday" â†’ `day_of_week = 'Monday'` etc.

Output format:
```<final_answer>[SQL_QUERY]</final_answer>```

Examples:

User: "Whatâ€™s on the cafe menu today?"  
â†’ <final_answer>SELECT item_name, item_type, price FROM cafe_menus WHERE date = CURDATE();</final_answer>

User: "When does the bus leave from campus to town tomorrow?"  
â†’ <final_answer>SELECT route_name, departure_time, arrival_time FROM bus_schedules WHERE departure_location LIKE '%campus%' AND arrival_location LIKE '%town%' AND date = CURDATE() + INTERVAL 1 DAY;</final_answer>

User: "What time is the software engineering lecture on Wednesday?"  
â†’ <final_answer>SELECT course_name, start_time, end_time, location FROM timetables WHERE course_name LIKE '%software engineering%' AND day_of_week = 'Wednesday';</final_answer>

Now generate the SQL query for the following user input:

"{user_input}"
    """
    print("agent called for structured question")
    response=connector(prompt)  # Call the connector function with user input
    
# Parse and extract classification
    result = response.json()
    raw_output = result.get("response", "")

# Print raw output for debugging
    print("\nðŸ“¦ Raw LLM Output:\n", raw_output)

# Step 5: Extract <final_answer>
    match = re.search(r"<final_answer>\s*(.*?)\s*</final_answer>", raw_output, re.DOTALL | re.IGNORECASE)

    if match:
       query = match.group(1).strip()
       print("\nâœ… qery generated:")
       print(query)
       conn=get_connection()
       cursor=conn.cursor()
       results = cursor.fetchall()
       print("\nðŸ“Š Query Results:"+ results)
